This repository provides implementations of both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer models for fake news detection. It allows you to compare different GNN architectures (such as GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, and GIN) with Transformer-based models (such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2). The codebase is flexible, allowing you to switch between these models with minimal changes.
